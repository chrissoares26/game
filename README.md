# Overview

I created a platform game in order to learn and practice Python and PyGame. I wanted to practice my OOP skills.
The game is simple to play. You move the main character with the arrow keys and you can jump with the space key. There are multiple levels. You need to avoide the lava and the slime enemies to survive
